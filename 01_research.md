			<h2>AI, Data Science and Digital Twinning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>As anthropogenic warming continues to put strain on our natural environments, it now is crucial that decision-makers have ready-access to actionable and timely information on the current states of environmental systems and future projections to help safeguard society and ecosystems around the world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twin technologies are rapidly becoming a central component to environmental research.

					<h3>Sea ice forecasting with deep learning</h3>
				</header>
				<p>IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system developed by an international team and led by British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute [Andersson et al., 2021]. IceNet has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss.</p>

					<h3>Environmental monitoring: blending satellite and surface data</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project aims to lay the foundations for ambitious research programmes to tackle our greatest environmental changes. We will develop and deploy reproducible and interpretable methods to increase scientific understanding, build tools to help environmental measurement planning, and provide the underpinning tools for intelligent real-time monitoring. The project aims to strengthen collaborations across the environmental and machine learning/AI communities by enhancing open-source and user-friendly computing platform.</p>

					<h3>AI for Smart Conservation</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Climate change is an increasingly pervasive threat to global biodiversity. Animal populations in the rapidly changing Arctic are often seen as a litmus test for the response of wildlife to climate change, particularly those whose life histories are inextricably tied to seasonal sea ice, such as polar bears, walrus, and certain caribou populations. As Arctic species navigate their increasingly unpredictable and diminishing sea ice habitat, conservation practitioners must develop adaptive management plans which are effective in these rapidly changing environments.</p>

					<h3>Automated tracking of sea ice and icebergs from satellites</h3>
				</header>
				<p>There are established methods for identification of sea ice floes and icebergs in radar satellite imagery although they struggle when different ice types are within close proximity. We are developing approaches that can combine various satellite products and associated weather information.</p>

			<h2>Tools for Digital Twinning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My team are developing open-source tools for digital twinning of the natural environments, as well as the BAS research ship and automated underwater vehicles for operational planning. By collaborating with a wide range of international research institutes and businesses our aim is to support international efforts to develop a Digital Twin Earth.</p>
