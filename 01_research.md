			<h2>AI, Data Science and Digital Twinning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>As anthropogenic warming continues to put strain on our natural environments, it now is crucial that decision-makers have ready-access to actionable and timely information on the current states of environmental systems and future projections to help safeguard society and ecosystems around the world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twin technologies are rapidly becoming central to the development of novel digital technologies, leading to step-changes in our capabilities. 
		<br><br>
		Digital Twinning is a next generation technology for purely process-based environmental modelling, taking us beyond purely process-based simulation models by enabling us to get answers to “what-if” questions within seconds. Digital Twins are already in operation in industry and involve highly interoperable data pipelines, optimisation, and a mixture of knowledge-informed and data-driven probabilistic machine learning. Digital Twins are increasingly becoming a key component for research discovery, education, and aiding discussions at the board-level without having to wait weeks to months for results from traditional computer models.</p>

					<h3>Sea Ice Forecasting</h3>
				</header>
				<p>IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system developed by an international team and led by British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute [Andersson et al., 2021]. IceNet has been trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps. IceNet advances the range of accurate sea ice forecasts, outperforming a state-of-the-art dynamical model in seasonal forecasts of summer sea ice, particularly for extreme sea ice events. This step-change in sea ice forecasting ability brings us closer to conservation tools that mitigate risks associated with rapid sea ice loss.</p>

					<h3>Environmental monitoring: blending satellite and surface data</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project aims to lay the foundations for ambitious research programmes to tackle our greatest environmental changes. We will develop and deploy reproducible and interpretable methods to increase scientific understanding, build tools to help environmental measurement planning, and provide the underpinning tools for intelligent real-time monitoring. The project aims to strengthen collaborations across the environmental and machine learning/AI communities by enhancing open-source and user-friendly computing platform.</p>

					<h3>Improving tracking of iceberg populations in the Southern Ocean</h3>
				</header>
				<p>There are established methods for identification of icebergs in radar satellite imagery mainly based on CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detection methods. However there are a number of limitations to these approaches, e.g. they work well in open ocean, but are less effective for icebergs within the sea ice pack or tabular icebergs in close proximity. New approaches will aim to identify icebergs in both the open ocean and in sea ice. Further improvements will consider information about iceberg size and shape, and tracking icebergs trajectories.</p>

			<h2>Tools for Digital Twinning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>BAS scientists and engineers are developing open-source tools for digital twinning of the natural environments, as well as the BAS research ship and automated underwater vehicles for operational planning. By collaborating with a wide range of international research institutes and businesses our aim is to support international efforts to develop a Digital Twin Earth.</p>
