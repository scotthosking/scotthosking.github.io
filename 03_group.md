<h1>Group</h1>

I lead a team across two research institutes, the [AI Lab](https://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) at the British Antarctic Survey and a group under the [Environment and Sustainability](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environment-and-sustainability) theme at The Alan Turing Institute. My team has interests in the application of machine learning for environmental science, and the development of digital twins of the natural environment.
