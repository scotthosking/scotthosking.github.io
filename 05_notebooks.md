<h1>Notebooks</h1>

Here are some Python notebooks I use for research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any comments, _even if just to say you found them useful_

## Getting started
* Using [BASpy with Xarray](/notebooks/baspy_using_xarray) to read in climate model data (CMIP5)
* Getting weather station data from around the globe (both [monthly](/notebooks/ghcn_monthly) and [daily](/notebooks/ghcn_daily) averaged data) 

## Research
* Seasonal sea ice prediction using the [icenet](https://edsbook.org/notebooks/gallery/ac327c3a-5264-40a2-8c6e-1e8d7c4b37ef/notebook.html) toolkit
* Automatic detection of low pressure weather and climate systems from sea-level pressure or geopotential height fields. Used here in this example to detect the [_Amundsen Sea Low_](/notebooks/asl_detection)
* Analysing simulated Antarctic preciptation from the [RACMO regional climate model](/notebooks/racmo_with_xarray)
* Working with model output from the [WRF regional climate model](/notebooks/wrf_with_xarray)

## Useful scripts
* Smoothing a timeseries [using a low-pass filter](/notebooks/smooth_timeseries)
