<h3 id="july-2025-EnvEcoStats">July 2025, EnvEcoStats -  satellite conference to the ISI World Statistics Congress 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Dr Scott Hosking is the Mission Director for Environmental Forecasting at the Alan Turing Institute, and the Head of the AI Lab at the British Antarctic Survey. His interests include fusion of multi-modal observational data, data-driven environmental forecasting, and developing the underpinning capabilities and digital infrastructure required for environmental digital twins.</p>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: End-to-end data-driven environmental prediction: from observations to decision-information</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In a changing climate, precise environmental prediction is essential for protecting people and economies. Recognising this, the Alan Turing Institute has formed a team dedicated to creating an advanced multi-modal AI prediction system that is flexible enough to integrate various data sources (satellites, weather stations, radiosondes). We are leading the development of the "Aardvark Weather" model, the first end-to-end AI weather model which streamlines the entire forecasting process - from data intake to decision-ready information - into a single AI model that's efficient enough to operate on a desktop computer. This holistic approach offers significant advantages, especially for developing countries where access to supercomputers and digital infrastructure is limited. Our aim is to develop end-to-end forecasting systems that can generalise for weather, sea ice, and ocean currents.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Scott Hosking started out in environmental AI around 2016 writing a few papers bringing novel digital methods into his research. Then around 2018 he setup the BAS AI Lab supported by seed funding secured from the Alan Turing Institute. Scott then joined the Turing in 2020 under a partial secondment to help expand his group. In February 2022 Scott was appointed as a BAS Science Leader in AI and joined the BAS Science Executive. Scott now has a group of around 20 members across both institutes, including scientists, engineers, and community leaders – some you will have met this week. And just last month Scott became the Co-Director for the £6m Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins hosted by the Alan Turing Institute where he plans to further expand his research activities, including in the development of spatiotemporal AI methods for environmental Digital Twins.</p>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: Spatiotemporal AI and Digital Twinning for the Polar Environment</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: British Antarctic Survey is one of the most multidisciplinary environmental research labs in the world and includes research in: space weather, atmospheric science, glaciology, ocean science and sea ice dynamics, and terrestrial and marine biology. The time scales BAS considers span seconds to millennia from the understanding of climate processes to signals in ice and sediment cores, while spatial scales range from the microscopic scale of dynamical and biological process to global and regional impacts from ice melt leading to sea level rise. This huge range of scientific challenges coupled with remote and extreme environments leaves us with some significant and chunky data challenges – this is where AI and autonomy comes in. In this talk I will cover the recent journey BAS has made in becoming a key player and UK partner in the area of environmental AI and digital twinning, and how we are developing generalisable spatiotemporal methods and digital solutions that could span across the entire remit of NERC.</p>

<h3 id="march-2021-epsrc-grant-outline">March 2021, EPSRC Grant Outline</h3>
<p>Hosking is a climate scientist, leader of the British Antarctic Survey AI Lab, Turing Senior Research Fellow, Co-Director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Environmental Risks, and Board member of the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science.</p>

<h3 id="january-2021-nerc-std-grant">January 2021, NERC Std Grant</h3>
<p>Scott Hosking (Co-I) is Head of the BAS AI Lab, where he leads a group applying state-of-the-art AI and ML methods to a range of environmental issues, and also a Senior Research Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK national institute for data science and AI. He has &gt;15 years’ experience in climate science and modelling, secured &gt;£7m in funding from UKRI and industry, and &gt;40 peer-reviewed publications, including CMIP6 (Simpson et al., 2020) and the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) model (Orr et al., 2020). He is PI on three environmental AI projects funded under the EPSRC Strategic Priorities Fund AI for Science, Engineering, Health and Government (EP/T001569/1). He is also co-director for the AI4ER CDT, a £6m UKRI funded programme to train &gt;50 students to become future global leaders in environmental AI and data science. Hosking will provide expert guidance on method development</p>
