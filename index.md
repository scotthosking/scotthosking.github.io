Over the past decade I have been dedicated to developing the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Environmental Science. My work has directly contributed to transforming how we predict and respond to environmental change, including climate and weather-related risks.

In 2018 I established the [BAS AI Lab](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai), through which I formed a research team to focus on forecasting changes in the polar regions. This resulted in my team developing the widely recognised [IceNet](http://icenet.ai) programme, which delivered the first AI-powered pan-Arctic seasonal sea ice forecasting model. IceNet represented a step-change in forecasting outperforming the traditional models, particularly in predicting extreme sea ice extent months in advance. The AI model was featured in [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/as-the-arctic-warms-ai-forecasts-scope-out-shifting-sea-ice/), by [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-model-predicts-sea-ice-loss/), the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct1lsl) and other news outlets, and the core publication was ranked among the [25 most downloaded](https://www.nature.com/collections/afchdbedbe) Nature Communications articles across Earth and Environmental Sciences published in 2021. IceNet was also showcased as an ["AI for Good"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scitechgovuk_aisafetysummit-aisafetysummit-activity-7125422735781961728-ucda/) exemplar by the UK government as part of the first International AI Safety Summit, 2023.

The innovation of IceNet has delivered significant, tangible impact. One major real-world application is our collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Government of Nunavut, which resulted in the ability to predict critical sea ice freeze-up dates which could be crucial for Arctic conservation including [Caribou migration](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/new-ai-tool-aids-caribou-conservation-in-a-changing-arctic/) and to facilitate effective management of polar bear surveys. This pioneering work was featured in a [2025 documentary](https://www.royal.uk/news-and-activity/2025-10-18/steve-backshalls-retraces-the-kings-steps-in-royal-arctic-challenge) with HRH King Charles III. 

Since joining the Alan Turing Institute, I expanded my work into the domain of AI for [optimised environmental sensing and monitoring](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/deepsensor) and weather forecasting which alongside IceNet now forms my _Mission in [Environmental Forecasting](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/environment-sustainability_)_. 

Developing sovereign environmental forecasting capabilities is a priority for my team. I was one of the founding members of the [Aardvark Weather model](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/project-aardvark-reimagining-ai-weather-prediction) team, a revolutionary system that replaces the entire, complex, traditional weather forecasting pipeline with a single, novel deep learning architecture. Aardvark can ingest multimodal data (satellites, weather stations, weather balloons) and generate a ten-day global forecast at speeds thousands of times faster than previous existing systems - _both traditional and AI-based_ - while running on a desktop computer. This technological breakthrough has helped to secure financial support from the Gates Foundation. We are now working to deploy Aardvark within West Africa, together with local meteorological services and university partners to upskill local expertise.

I am also one of two Senior Responsible Owners (SROs) for the [FastNet weather forecasting model](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/fastnet) and a [senior author](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17601v1) on the 2025 pre-print involving collaboration across a 34-author team. This new AI model is being developed in partnership between the Alan Turing Institute and the UK Met Office, and aims to become the UK’s first AI operational weather forecasting model.
