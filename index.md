From the icy plains of Antarctica to the forefront of AI research, my career has been driven by a singular passion: protecting our planet. Today, I stand at the intersection of these two worlds, leading a team of brilliant minds at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/). Together, we're harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence to create digital twins – virtual replicas of Earth's systems – that can help us understand, predict, and ultimately solve the challenges of climate change.

It all started with a deep fascination for Earth's intricate climate system. As a PhD student at Cambridge, I dove into the world of global climate modeling, building complex simulations to unravel the mysteries of our planet's changing behavior. This journey led me to the British Antarctic Survey, where I established the [AI Lab](https://www.bas.ac.uk/ai) – a hub for exploring the potential of AI in environmental research. Joining the Turing was the logical next step, merging my expertise in environmental science and AI to foster groundbreaking collaborations.

Our projects are as diverse as the ecosystems we study. We're [merging data from satellites and ground sensors](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environmental-monitoring-blending-satellite-and-surface-data) to create a real-time pulse of our planet, developing new machine learning algorithms to [forecast our weather](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-numerical-weather-prediction-nwp-ai4nwp), and developing AI-powered tools to [track wildlife populations](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/ai-for-smart-conservation/) and monitor environmental change. I'm particularly excited about our [Antarctic Digital Twin programme](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/digital-twins-of-the-polar-regions/), which aims to provide near-instantaneous insights for informed decision-making in this crucial region.

My career has been supported by incredible collaborations, partnerships, and a dash of recognition along the way. Our research has been featured in [Nature Communications](https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/artificial-intelligence-to-help-predict-arctic-sea-ice-loss/), [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-model-predicts-sea-ice-loss/), [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/as-the-arctic-warms-ai-forecasts-scope-out-shifting-sea-ice/) and our group was acknowledged as an ["AI for Good" exemplar by the UK government](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scitechgovuk_aisafetysummit-aisafetysummit-activity-7125422735781961728-ucda/). But the most rewarding moments are witnessing the impact of our work – informing policies, shaping sustainable practices, and ultimately, giving our planet a voice through the power of AI.

There's still so much to explore, and I'm excited to continue this journey, one digital twin at a time. If you share my passion for protecting our planet, [let's](https://bsky.app/profile/scotthosking.bsky.social) [connect!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scotthosking/) I'm always eager to collaborate, share knowledge, and inspire others to join the fight for a sustainable future.

P.S. I'm a firm believer in the power of open collaboration. Feel free to [join our Slack](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=p_SVQ1XklU-Knx-672OE-ZmEJNLHTHVFkqQ97AaCfn9UNU1PMUo4QkdYWTdXR0VPRlZSRjJQTktRWC4u) if you're interested in joining our mission!

<!-- I am a Co-Director for the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins ([TRIC-DT](https://www.turing.ac.uk/tricdigitaltwins)), leading a team of scientists and engineers across both [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai). Our aim is in the development of AI and digital twin technologies for monitoring, understanding, predicting and designing solutions for environmental change. 

Our projects include the [intelligent fusion of data from satellite and in-situ surface sensors](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environmental-monitoring-blending-satellite-and-surface-data) to help understand our changing planet; probabilistic machine learning for localised climate impacts; [AI for seasonal sea ice forecasting](/icenet) and improving climate models; and [computer vision toolkits](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision) for tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.

I am also a Co-Director for the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science.  -->
