I am a Co-Director for the Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins ([TRIC-DT](https://www.turing.ac.uk/tricdigitaltwins)), leading a team of scientists and engineers across both [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and the [British Antarctic Survey](http://www.bas.ac.uk/ai). Our aim is in the development of AI and digital twin technologies for monitoring, understanding, predicting and designing solutions for environmental change. 

Our projects include the [intelligent fusion of data from satellite and in-situ surface sensors](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/environmental-monitoring-blending-satellite-and-surface-data) to help understand our changing planet; probabilistic machine learning for localised climate impacts; [AI for seasonal sea ice forecasting](/icenet) and improving climate models; and [computer vision toolkits](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision) for tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.

I am also a Co-Director for the Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the [Application of AI to the study of Environmental Risks](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) (AI4ER), a £6m UKRI funded programme to train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental science.
